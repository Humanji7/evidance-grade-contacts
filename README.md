# evidance-grade-contacts
Evidence-Grade Contacts (EGC) is a proof-of-concept system that extracts people (name, title) and business contacts (email/phone/links) from public pages of corporate websites with a mandatory “mini evidence package” for every fact. Rendering is static-first, with targeted escalation to Playwright when needed.
